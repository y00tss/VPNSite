Hello SheepFish

Unfortunately I didn`t implement the main thing of the task - VPN connection. I never had the experience. 
Separately I performed the task and changed the IP using own proxy from service databases that I added info model Proxy, but sites are not provide the access with VPN inside my sile using IFAME

Let`s start

Main page:

    - "There is a logo of the company, information, and a support form (without a connected database, just a frontend form)."
    - "Additionally, JS scripts for animations have been added."

VPN page:
    
        - "There are 2 selectors for sites and proxies. Before starting, you need to add the site and choose a site and proxy. *If somebody is using the proxy, it may not be available for others*."
        - "There are 2 buttons for adding sites and starting the VPN connection."

Adding sites:

        - "There are 2 input forms for the name of the site and its link. After pressing 'Add site'..."

Start VPN:

        - "You will be redirected to a new link according to the task, inside a frame with !!!(without)!!! VPN connection. On the page, you can see the expected IP address."

Profile page:
        
        - "You can view your profile, edit it, and log out."
        - "You can also see your personal statistics like 'site: number of visits'."

Admin page:
        
        - "You can see the list of custom users, user actions, websites, and proxies (which can be added only by the admin)."
